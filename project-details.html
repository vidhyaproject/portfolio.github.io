   <center> <pre style="font-size: large;">
    Drunk and driving is a reason behind most of the deaths. Drunk and driving is the leading cause 
    of road accidents.The method of manual checking or scanning the vehicle drivers by using breath 
    analyzers is increasingly difficult for traffic cops. To avoid the difficulty for traffic cops,
    the  automated  drunk and drive, accident detection system with car ignition lock is implemented 
    by using Raspberry PI Pico which aims to change with automated transparent, non-invasive alcohol 
    safety checks in vehicles. This system uses ALCOHOL sensor MQ135, MEMS sensor, DC Motor and GSM 
    module.,GSM module locates the site of the accident and correspondingly informs the person near 
    ones through a text message. This system continuously monitors the sensitivity of alcohol sensors
    of drunk and rivers. If the driver is drunk, the processor instantly stops the system ignition by 
    stopping the DC motor otherwise the engine will run accordingly. The MEMS sensor is placed near the 
    engine and it will find the tilt of the sensor and detects the accidents and activates GSM module 
    to send an SMS alert that consists of the location of the vehicle and to registered mobile number.
